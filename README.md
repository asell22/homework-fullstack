# homework-fullstack

Timebox this homework to 3 hours or less.  KPCC strives to be sensitive to candidatesâ€™ time and effort involved in our interview process, and while we do not expect candidates to spend more than 3 hours on this, we do evaluate submitted solutions on their attention to detail. We will evaluate not only the architecture and implementation of the provided solution, but will
also review tests, read READMEs and code comments, and inspect commits and commit messages. The intention of the code challenge is for us to get a sense of how you normally complete work tasks.

## To Run Locally
1. Have node.js installed on your machine - preferably v13.8.0 ( I have not tested if this breaks with earlier versions of node )

1. Once you're in project directory, run **npm i**. This will install dependencies.

1. **npm start** - This will run the server locally on your machine. The local server is running on port 3000. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.

## Implementation
1. This application was generated with the [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) tool. It uses [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for its server-side technology and vanilla JavaScript for its client-side technology.

## Todos
Timeboxing development left some tasks remaining. Here are a couple:
1. Testing - This application should use some testing framework (e.g. Jest or Mocha) to verify expectations when making requests to api endpoints.

1. UI - A spinner should render after the xhr request has been sent.
